Back end for U Vote It, a voting application for developer meetup group called U Develop It. 

This was made as an exercise in storing structured data in a relational database and using the MySQL command-line interface.

The database consists of 3 tables: candidates, parties and voters. All have CRUD routes.

## Installation
- Clone the repository.
- Create a `.env` file and add `DB_PW =` with your MySql password.
- Run `npm start` in the terminal.

## Usage
- Routes can be used through an API client; I used Insomnia.
